# beer-app

A React Single Page App displaying random beer and allowing for searching beers.

The application is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) platform and it's available here:

<https://beer-app-323.netlify.app/>

## Setup

In order to run this project locally, download the git repository, then in the project folder:

install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

run the app locally:

```
yarn start
```

## Testing Requirements

In order to run tests inside the application, run the following command:

```
yarn test
```

It will run all tests in the application and return the result of testing with coverage. In the summary you can see the number of tests written and passed / failed. Moreover you can find there a detailer report of coverage split by statements, branches, functions and lines. The tests are not covering 100% of the application - it's simplified testing and the main purpose is to show the approach and ideas how to test such application, instead of reaching 100% of coverage. Current coverage is around 80%, and it is known issue.

For testing it's been used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/). This libraries allow to mount the components and make assertion on them, for example if the component has rendered proper children, text, data, etc. by creating special data-test-id tags and comparing snapshots.

Alternatively, for mocking api calls I would use [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock), to prepare an isolated environment for testing the app. Also [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro) is worth considering, for component testing.

For e2e testing I would prepare some nonprod and prod environment, like deployment on the Netlify platform.
Current version of the app would be tested by some test written with tool like [webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io/). The tests would go to
the page and travel through it simulating the user - searching beers, fetching random beers, etc. The
tests would check if proper button are in place, if after the click the proper view appears, etc. Tests would compare
the views for given scenario and verify if the view is as expected.

## Caching Requirements

The task required taking into consideration api resource limit, which allows to hit the endpoint once per second. I used the simplified solution, which blocks buttons and fetching handlers for a second after request triggered by the user. It's been used a react state lifting strategy. In real scenario, there is a plenty of solution for solve such issue, like caching some requests, or fetching more data than required and displaying some parts of it during next few requests, etc.

## Technology, Tools, Workflow

The application was written with [React](https://pl.reactjs.org/) library, which is powerful and complex tool for creating web application
while being fast, lightweight and performant. Apllication is using React Router, component asynchronus lazy loading,
JSX component definition, etc. State handling is implemented with modern React Hooks approach, so that's why every
component is a function component. The whole application is developed with composition approach, with no need of
using class components.

Project has been written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - it's a superset of [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
Main reason of using Typescript is the typing posibility. We can define type of values, functions, components, interfaces, etc. what generates the more solid and stable code,
less error prone, and much easier to read by developers. At first glimpse someone can see what data a function or component
requires and what data is returned as a result. During the build process Typescript is transpiled to Javascript and the
types are removed from the bundle.

For components styling there has been used a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) stylesheet language which is fully compiled to CSS. It comes
with great features allowing constants definition, common styles inheritance, composition, importing, etc. which
reduces copying the same styles between components and application elements. To reach responsive web app I used flex styles for dynamically
adjust component size and place according to the screen size, and also provided dynamic font calculation.

Project is using a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) bundler, which is a very popular tool used for building the application and maintain the
dependencies. It allows to define a development and optimized production build. Most important features are: production build
optimization, code splitting into smaller chunks, tree shaking, hot reload during development, bundle analysis and much more.

For request making to the Beer API, project uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library, popular and tested dependency.

All beer icons are fetched asynchronously with [react-lazyload](https://github.com/twobin/react-lazyload) library (simple and reusable, but for better
performance it's recommened to implement own solution - for example with Intersection Observer Api etc. to remove dependency)

To sum up, technology used in the project is:

- React
- Typescript
- Sass
- axios
- react-lazyload
- Jest
- Enzyme

The project has been developed and stored in git, hosted on GitHub repository. Git provides code maitenance and it's a source of
code version control system. As the application was developed by one developer, branching was not used. Every chunk
of work has been contributed as a separate commit, allowing for keeping simple code history.

Git repository is bound to Netlify build system, every code change on master triggers automatically a deploy to production.

The workflow I used to solve this task:

- implement the funcionality of the application and basic styling, according to the changes, writing tests - in chunks / commits
- every bit of work deployed to Netlify for manual testing and spotting issues on different devices,
- once functionality is complete, adjusting proper final styling of application and testing
- refactoring of code and styles
- adjust optimization techniques (react hooks, lazy loading, memoization, rerendering analysis)
- analysis of bundle and split the bundle into chunks, verify proper Webpack config
- ready solution verified by [Goggle Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in order to spot some performance drawbacks
- fix of performance drawbacks and final bug fixes

## Performance

In order to provide best performance possible I would introduce the strategy I started in the task.

1. I would check the build of bundles with webpack and webpack-bundle-analyzer, if required I would split the code and
   dependencies in a way that would provide the chunks small enough. I would use the webpack features (tree shaking,
   code splitting) to provide optimized bundles and use some React techiques like React lazy and Suspense to split code -
   this allow user to see first view as soon as possible, then fetch asynchronously the rest of the code.
2. I would use React Hooks and memoization, combined with react-devtools, chrome-devtools (performance tab, flame graph),
   to spot any performance issues connected to state handling, rerendering, animation, blocking execution etc.
3. I would use the reports like LightHouse or PageSpeed Insights or WebPageTest to spot potential issues and solve,
   any performance and drawbacks.
4. I would use some tool like [oWASP](https://owasp.org/) to verify if the application is safe and not easy to hack - it would allow to find
   and solve any possible risks according to web attacks.
5. I would introduce some in-code optimization strategies like cache - for saving the redundant api requests, use only best formats
   like webp for image, woff2 for fonts, define priority of fetching resources with defer, async, onload tags, etc.

## Maintenance, CI-CD

In order to introduce proper maintenance, I would introduce git flow. Every feature and fix should be developed in
separate branch. Every branch would have a proper pipelines, validating the build, triggering the unit tests, verify
the bundle size, etc. It would allow also to deploy the feature version to nonprod environment for adittional manual testing.

After fully passed pipelines and approved work by other developers, work could be merged to
main branch. The main branch also would have a pipeline set confirming the test, bundle size, etc. it would deploy  
the version to nonprod environment and run e2e tests aditionally to verify correctness of the application.
Also some report mechanizm like Lighthouse would be triggered after deployment to verify the applicaton. Once the pipelines
are green, it will be available to bump up the version of application and make the release to prod environment.
Versioning of the application would be done according to the semantic-versioning.
